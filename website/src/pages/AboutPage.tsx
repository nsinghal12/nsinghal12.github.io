        <h1>about me</h1>
        <p>Working in the tech industry for 10 years had provided me with deep insights on how the new world was shaping up by embracing technology. As a mainframe developer I had seen the precursor to big data in the financial and insurance domain. Lately, I saw how the advancement in web technologies were reshaping studies, shopping, planning vacations, watching movies, cooking, banking and more. This made me lean towards web development, and I started with a few online courses.</p>
        <p>At the next break, I took the opportunity for learning web development at GA full-time to hone my skills, polish the nuances and begin my career as a web developer.</p>
