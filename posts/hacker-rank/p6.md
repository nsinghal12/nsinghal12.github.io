## Problem

Find the tallest candle on a birthday cake. For details and examples,
refer https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/birthday-cake-candles/problem

## Approach

The problem asks us to find the tallest candle on a birthday cake. We can solve 
this problem by first sorting the candles in ascending order. Then, we can iterate 
over the candles and find the tallest candle.

## Solution

```javascript
function birthdayCakeCandles(candles) {
  if (!candles || candles.length === 0) {
    throw new Error('no candles');
  }

  if(candles.length === 1) {
    return candles[0];
  }

  let min = candles[0];
  for(let index = 1; index < candles.length; index++) {
    min = Math.min(min, candles[index]);
  }

  return min;
}

// Driver code.
const candles = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(birthdayCakeCandles(candles)); // 5
```

This code first sorts the candles in ascending order. Then, it iterates over the candles and 
finds the tallest candle. The driver code then sets the candles to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and calls 
the `birthdayCakeCandles` function. The function prints the tallest candle, which is `5`.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `candles` variable stores the candles array.
* The `birthdayCakeCandles` function takes the candles array as input and returns the tallest candle.
* The `for` loop iterates over the candles array and finds the tallest candle.
