## Problem

Draw a staircase of height N using `#` characters in CLI mode. For details 
and examples, refer https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/staircase/problem

## Approach

The problem asks us to print a staircase of a given height. The staircase 
should have `n` steps, where `n` is the height.

We can solve this problem by first creating a function that prints a single step 
of the staircase. This function should take the height of the step as input and 
print a string of spaces followed by a hash symbol.

Then, we can use a recursive function to print the entire staircase. This function 
should take the height of the staircase as input and print the steps one by one.

## Solution

```javascript
function printStep(height) {
  const spaces = " ".repeat(height - 1);
  console.log(`${spaces}#`);
}

function printStaircase(height) {
  if (height === 0) {
    return;
  }

  printStep(height);
  printStaircase(height - 1);
}

// Driver code.
const height = 5;

printStaircase(height);
```

This code first creates a function that prints a single step of the staircase. This function takes 
the height of the step as input and prints a string of spaces followed by a hash symbol. Then, it 
creates a recursive function to print the entire staircase. This function takes the height of the 
staircase as input and prints the steps one by one. The driver code then sets the height of the staircase 
to 5 and calls the printStaircase function. The function prints the staircase, which is a series of 5 steps.
