## Problem

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals. For details 
and examples, refer https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/diagonal-difference/problem

## Approach

The problem asks us to calculate the absolute difference between the sums of the main and secondary diagonals 
of a square matrix. The main diagonal is the diagonal that runs from the top left corner to the bottom right 
corner of the matrix, and the secondary diagonal is the diagonal that runs from the top right corner to the 
bottom left corner of the matrix.

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

* Create a two-dimensional array to represent the square matrix.
* Initialize two variables, `mainDiagonalSum` and `secondaryDiagonalSum`, to 0.
* Iterate through the array, adding the elements on the main diagonal to mainDiagonalSum and the elements on 
the secondary diagonal to secondaryDiagonalSum.
* Calculate the absolute difference between mainDiagonalSum and secondaryDiagonalSum.
* Print the absolute difference.

## Solution

```javascript
function diagonalDifference(arr) {
  // Initialize the left and right diagonal sums.
  let leftDiagonalSum = 0;
  let rightDiagonalSum = 0;

  // Iterate over the array and add the elements on the left and right diagonals.
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    leftDiagonalSum += arr[i][i];
    rightDiagonalSum += arr[i][arr.length - 1 - i];
  }

  // Return the difference between the two sums.
  return Math.abs(leftDiagonalSum - rightDiagonalSum);
}

// Driver code.
const arr = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
];
```

This code first initializes two variables, `leftDiagonalSum` and `rightDiagonalSum`, to store the 
sums of the left and right diagonals, respectively. Then, it iterates over the array and adds 
the elements on the left and right diagonals to the corresponding variables. Finally, it returns 
the difference between the two sums.

The driver code then creates an array of numbers and passes it to the `diagonalDifference` function. 
The function returns the difference between the left and right diagonal sums.
