## Problem

Find the min and max sum of a subset in an array. For details and examples,
refer https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/mini-max-sum/problem

## Approach 

The problem asks us to find the minimum and maximum possible sums of a subset of a given array.

We can solve this problem by first finding the sum of the entire array. Then, we can iterate 
over the array and find the minimum and maximum sums of a subset that excludes each element.

## Solution

```javascript
function miniMaxSum(arr) {
  const sum = arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
  let minSum = sum;
  let maxSum = 0;

  for (const num of arr) {
    minSum = Math.min(minSum, sum - num);
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum - num);
  }

  return [minSum, maxSum];
}
```

This code first finds the sum of the entire array. Then, it iterates over the array and finds the 
minimum and maximum sums of a subset that excludes each element. The driver code then sets the array 
to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and calls the miniMaxSum function. The function prints the minimum and maximum 
sums, which are 10 and 14, respectively.
