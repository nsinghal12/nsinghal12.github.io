## Problem

Ref: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/circular-array-rotation/problem

## Approach

The problem asks us to find the element at a given index after a circular rotation of the array.

We can solve this problem by first finding the index of the element after the rotation. Then, we can return the element at that index.

## Solution

```javascript
function circularArrayRotation(arr, rotation, index) {
   const rotatedArr = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    rotatedArr[(i + rotation) % arr.length] = arr[i];
  }

  const results = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < index.length; i++) {
    results.push(rotatedArr[index[i]]);
  }
  return results;
}
```

This code first creates a new array called `rotatedArr`. Then, it iterates over the 
original array and adds the elements to `rotatedArr` after rotating them by the number 
of rotations specified. Finally, it creates a new array called `results` and adds the 
elements at the specified indices from `rotatedArr`.

The driver code then sets the array to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the rotations to `2`, and the 
indices to `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. The `circularArrayRotation` function then returns the values 
of the elements at the given indices, which is `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `arr` variable stores the original array.
* The `rotations` variable stores the number of rotations.
* The `indices` variable stores the indices of the elements to find.
* The `circularArrayRotation` function takes the original array, the number of rotations, and the indices as input and returns the values of the elements at the given indices.
* The `%` operator calculates the remainder of the division of two numbers.
* The `console.log` method prints the values of the elements at the given indices.
