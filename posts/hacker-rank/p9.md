## Problem

Ref: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/circular-array-rotation/problem

## Approach

The problem asks us to find the element at a given index after a circular rotation of the array.

We can solve this problem by first finding the index of the element after the rotation. Then, we can return the element at that index.

## Solution

```javascript
function circularArrayRotation(arr, rotation, index) {
  const rotatedIndex = (index + rotation) % arr.length;

  return arr[rotatedIndex];
}

// Driver code.
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const rotation = 2;
const index = 0;

console.log(circularArrayRotation(arr, rotation, index)); // 3
```

This code first finds the index of the element after the rotation. Then, it returns the 
element at that index.

The driver code then sets the array to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the rotation to 2, and the index to 0. 
The `circularArrayRotation` function then returns the element at index 0 after the rotation, which is 3.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `arr` variable stores the array.
* The `rotation` variable stores the rotation count.
* The `index` variable stores the index of the element to find.
* The `circularArrayRotation` function takes the array, rotation count, and index as input and returns the element at the given index after the rotation.
* The `%` operator calculates the remainder of the division of two numbers.
* The `console.log` method prints the element at the given index after the rotation.
