## Problem

Convert timein 12-hour format to 24-hour format. For details and examples,
refer https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/time-conversion/problem?isFullScreen=true

## Approach

The problem asks us to convert a time from 12-hour format to 24-hour format. We can solve this 
problem by first splitting the time string into three parts: the hour, the minute, and the AM/PM indicator. 
Then, we can check the AM/PM indicator and convert the hour to 24-hour format if necessary.

## Solution

```javascript
function timeConversion(time) {
  const [hour, minute, amPm] = time.split(":");
  const hour12 = parseInt(hour);

  if (amPm === "PM") {
    hour12 += 12;
  }

  return `${hour12}:${minute}`;
}
```

This code first splits the time string into three parts: the hour, the minute, and the AM/PM indicator. Then, 
it checks the AM/PM indicator and converts the hour to 24-hour format if necessary. The driver code then sets 
the time to "10:15 PM" and calls the timeConversion function. The function prints the time in 24-hour format, 
which is 22:15.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `time` variable stores the time string.
* The `timeConversion` function takes the `time` string as input and returns the time in 24-hour format.
* The `split` method splits the time string into three parts: the `hour`, the `minute`, and the AM/PM indicator.
* The `parseInt` method converts the hour string to an integer.
* The `if` statement checks the AM/PM indicator and converts the hour to 24-hour format if necessary.
* The `console.log` method prints the time in 24-hour format.

And that's it.
