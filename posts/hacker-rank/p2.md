## Problem

Alice and Bob created problems for HackerRank and received ratings from a reviewer. The problem 
is to find their comparison points by comparing the ratings of their challenges. The comparison 
points are the total points a person earned. For details 
and examples, refer https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/compare-the-triplets/problem

## Approach
The problem asks us to compare three numbers from two arrays and return 1 if the first array has a 
greater sum, -1 if the second array has a greater sum, and 0 if the two arrays have the same sum.

We can solve this problem by first initializing two variables, firstSum and secondSum, to store the 
sums of the first and second arrays, respectively. Then, we can iterate over the arrays and add the 
elements to the corresponding variables. Finally, we can return the difference between the two sums.

## Solution

```javascript
function compareTriplets(a, b) {
  // Initialize the sums of the two arrays.
  let firstSum = 0;
  let secondSum = 0;

  // Iterate over the arrays and add the elements to the corresponding sums.
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    firstSum += a[i];
    secondSum += b[i];
  }

  // Return the difference between the two sums.
  return firstSum - secondSum;
}

// Driver code.
const a = [1, 2, 3];
const b = [4, 5, 6];
```
