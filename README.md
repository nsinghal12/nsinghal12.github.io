# Niti Singhal

Hi! I'm Niti Singhal, a software engineer who loves to build cool React components 
and websites. My personal website is https://nitisinghal.com.

I mainly use JavaScript, TypeScript, and React for my work. I'm also interested in 
GenAI, and I've recently started experimenting with NodeJS, OpenAI, and other AI 
tools such as MidJourney and Leonardo.

This repository contains all of my code and writings for my personal website. I 
hope you find it useful! If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free 
to contact me.

I'm always looking for new challenges, so if you have any interesting projects in 
mind, please don't hesitate to reach out!
